sesq
====

sesq is an adaptable *sesquichromatic* syntax highlighting color scheme for
Pygments [1], designed to be used on web pages (instead of in editors), in
particular to match the styles of karasu [2] and my maze.

See

  https://krasjet.com/voice/sesq/

for a detailed introduction.


Usage
-----

sesq.py:
  Pygments definitions
syntax.css:
  CSS files generated by Pygments
pandoc.css:
  Manually crafted version for Pandoc, used when Pygments is not available.
  Skylighting's lexers are not very good, so use with caution.

Note that `italic` in the color theme definition means "medium" weight, not
actual italics. Pygments only support one font weight, so I have to use a hack.

sesq is an adaptable **sesquichromatic** syntax highlighting color scheme for
[Pygments](https://pygments.org/), designed to be used on web pages (instead of
in editors), in particular to match the styles of [karasu](https://krasjet.com/voice/karasu/) and my maze.

Due to the limitations of GitHub's Markdown. Please see
[**here**](https://krasjet.com/voice/sesq/) for detailed introduction.

Note that `italic` in the color theme definition means "medium" weight, not
actual italics. Pygments only support one font weight, so I have to use a hack.

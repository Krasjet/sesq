sesq is an adaptable **sesquichromatic** syntax highlighting color scheme for
[Pygments][pygments], designed to be used on web pages (instead of in editors),
in particular to match the styles of [karasu][karasu] and my maze.

Due to the limitations of the medium, please see [**here**][sesq] for detailed
introduction.

Usage
=====

```
sesq.py:
  Pygments definitions
syntax.css:
  CSS files generated by Pygments
pandoc.css:
  Manually crafted version for Pandoc, used when Pygments is not available.
  Skylighting's lexers are not very good, so use with caution.
```

Note that `italic` in the color theme definition means "medium" weight, not
actual italics. Pygments only support one font weight, so I have to use a hack.
